My opinions are my own, and I represent myself.</p> <p>Secondly, these ideas written forth are subject to change (written early Aug 2021). Yet, fundamentals likely stay the<br>
same, some nuances may differ.</p> <p>Becoming a programmer is a difficult journey. There is no easy button in life, nor in coding. This path will require<br>
dedication, perseverance, and craftspersonship. To &quot;make it&quot; is a state of mind. But letting arrogance rip, &quot;making it&quot;<br>
to me is a 6-figure occupation in the Norther Virgina area, with enough room to comfortably raise a family, and afford a<br>
humble place of our own.</p> <p>To be a &quot;no shit&quot; programmer requires obsession. A puzzle that is constantly in your mind. On your drive to the grocery<br>
store, you think of code. On a casual walk through the park, you randomly epiphanized the solution to that problem you<br>
worked on for two days (technology-free walks are a serious matter, this event clears our minds and must happen<br>
exceedingly frequently in the COVID world). When having a &quot;sit-down&quot; conversation with our friends and loved ones, we<br>
think about code. This strains relationships. It's not easy, but at the same time, it's who we are and part of our<br>
blood. It's how we're &quot;wired&quot; and to us, &quot;it is what it is&quot; and we see no other way. To others and to ourselves, we<br>
&quot;live with it&quot;. Typically, disregarding those around us and struggling to keep relationships intact rather than keeping<br>
relationships intact and struggling to figure things out.</p> <p>Nevertheless, in most areas of America (and the world), <strong>who</strong> you know is far more important than <strong>what</strong> you know.<br>
An unfortunate problem technology could certainly solve. LinkedIn attempted it, but it's far from perfection. Human<br>
interaction is the key to success in a career; and what we know as programmers has to surface in the form of<br>
comprehensible language to a person who is non-technical. Making <em>their</em> ideas (which are sometimes your own) come to<br>
fruition.</p> <p><strong>Being the smartest person in the room means <u>nothing</u>. Being the person that can make the least knowledgeable<br>
person understand said topic; is the smartest person in the room. This means everything.</strong></p> <p>The path of &quot;programmer&quot; is <strong>not</strong> a &quot;nine-to-five job&quot; nor should it be. We as programmers have a tremendous<br>
responsibility. We have a passion for <em>something</em>. That <em>something</em> drives our daily activities. And luckily, that<br> <em>something</em> happens to make a decent amount of money in today's world; yet we seem to be broke most of the time because<br>
we bought 4 new Raspberry Pi's instead of using the 2 we already have. Or something to that effect.</p> <p>A programmer must care about their craft. Like an artist, their craft is everything. Not something to be bartered, but a<br>
serious internal accountability for perfection. A programmer must obsess over optimization, simplicity, and beauty of<br>
their code. Whilst code is artwork, numbers undermine most of our cleverness. If a snippet of code under-performs<br>
another of <strong>equal</strong> robustness, it no longer has worth.</p> <p>Code should be readable, like a children's book we are taught as young. Spaced out syntax with readable variables;<br>
rather than &quot;lets smash this as close together as possible because it looks cool&quot; - a programmers craft is a work of<br>
art. That work of art <strong>should</strong> be and <strong>will</strong> be publicly scrutinized. Scrutineer's should be taken seriously and<br>
perceived with open mind. Thus, the circle of self-critical betterment begins.</p></div> <footer class="page-edit"><div class="edit-link"><a href="https://github.com/iSkore/blog.git/edit/master/docs/guide.md" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Edit</a> <span><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false" x="0px" y="0px" viewBox="0 0 100 100" width="15" height="15" class="icon outbound"><path fill="currentColor" d="M18.8,85.1h56l0,0c2.2,0,4-1.8,4-4v-32h-8v28h-48v-48h28v-8h-32l0,0c-2.2,0-4,1.8-4,4v56C14.8,83.3,16.6,85.1,18.8,85.1z"></path> <polygon fill="currentColor" points="45.7,48.7 51.3,54.3 77.2,28.5 77.2,37.2 85.2,37.2 85.2,14.9 62.8,14.9 62.8,22.9 71.5,22.9"></polygon></svg> <span class="sr-only">(opens new window)</span></span></div> <!----></footer> <!----> </main></div><div class="global-ui"></div></div>
