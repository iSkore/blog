# brain-teasers (READ ME!!!)

Brain teasers are fun coding problems to test your mind.
There's nothing fun about immediately looking the problem up.
In fact, more frequently than not I see incorrect answers come up first on Google.
Each problem should be read, then carefully thought out.
Test yourself, your logic, and think of all possiblilities before putting down some code.
Some of these problems are challenging, some are simple, and most of them have very simple answers.

Some problems are collected from various websites.
Some come from interview questions.
Some are just made up.
Most come from teaching of the best mentor I've ever had [Julian Jensen](https://github.com/julianjensen).

Enjoy.
