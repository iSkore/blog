# brain-teasers (READ ME!!!)

Brain teasers are fun coding problems to test your mind.
There's nothing fun about immediately looking the problem up.
In fact, more frequently than not I see incorrect answers come up first on Google.
Each problem should be read, then carefully thought out.
Test yourself, your logic, and think of all possiblilities before putting down some code.
Some of these problems are challenging, some are simple, and most of them have very simple answers.

Some problems are collected from various websites.
Some come from interview questions.
Some are just made up.
Most come from teaching of the best mentor I've ever had [Julian Jensen](https://github.com/julianjensen).

**All problems are in JavaScript syntax but the logic remains relatively the same across all programming languages**

**All problems have difficulty notations next to them - (I) is the easiest, (V) is the hardest**

### Setting up your environment for these brain-teasers

1. Download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) (LTS or Current does not matter for these exercises)
2. Download and install an editor. I recommend [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) but a free editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) or [Atom](https://atom.io/) works just fine too.
3. Open your editor, create a file, make your edits
3a. run the file through the editor
3b. or open terminal, `cd ~/<your project directory>` and execute the file `node brain-teaser.js`
4. Enjoy.
